Music Terrain Generator for Maya

README

    Music Terrain Generator (MTG) for Maya is a script that produces terrain
    from WAV audio files. It is not only limited to plane geometry and can 
    be used on any Polygon based object to manipulate based on the 
    amplitude of the song file.

NOTICE

    I most likely won't make any changes to the program from now as it's an
    old assignment I completed for my course (Computer Visualisation & 
    Animation) at the NCCA. The final version was published on 19/06/2015.

    I tried implementing a progress window with some Threading but Maya 
    only uses one main thread for its commands and this means that I would 
    have to re-work the entire code to get that working. Bear in mind that if 
    you start the script to generate Terrain that you have the time to finish it 
    since there is no way of exiting out of the currently running script.
